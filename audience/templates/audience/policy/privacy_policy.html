            <p>We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to
                our
                third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their
                Privacy
                Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI
                Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American
                Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment
                information.
